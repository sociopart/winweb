# ![WinWeb](/docs/resources/ww-logo.png)

WinWeb is a powerful and easy-to-use C/C++ library designed to
simplify file downloads and interaction with the Windows API. 

It provides a set of functions, constants, and data structures that enable
developers to effortlessly download files from URLs and handle various aspects
of the download process.

Goals of this project:
- Be fast and backward-compatible. Using C99 and WinInet, you can achieve two
  goals at once: WinInet is present (or might be installed) since 3.11.
- Be easy. You can download a file with one line of code.
- Be flexible. But you still do plenty of things, such as displaying raw HTTP
  headers, showing log, customising the progressbar look... Thousands of them!

Feel free to use and contribute!
