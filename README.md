# ![WinWeb](/docs/resources/ww-logo.png)

The WinWeb library is a powerful and easy-to-use C/C++ library designed to
simplify file downloads and interaction with the WinAPI on Windows platforms. 

It provides a set of functions, constants, and data structures that enable
developers to effortlessly download files from URLs and handle various aspects
of the download process.

Library was designed as WinAPI/C99 as it can be. So it (in theory) can be used
everywhere where `wininet.dll` is present (Windows 3.11 till latest Windows).
